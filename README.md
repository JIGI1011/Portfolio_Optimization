# Portfolio_Optimization
This project demonstrates portfolio optimization using financial data from five major NIFTY 50 companies during the COVID-19 period (2020 to mid-2021). We use Monte Carlo simulation and constrained optimization techniques to identify the most efficient allocation of assets that maximize return while minimizing risk.
